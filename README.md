# PoetDiary
This is a web app where you can create and view creative writing pieces and store them in a journal like. I love to write poetry but have a hard time keeping up with paper poems or even ones that I write on my phone. This program has saved me time and the fustration of losing a poem or finding a safe place to keep it. I can now keep all of my poems in one place and can also get inspired by my friends' poems.
